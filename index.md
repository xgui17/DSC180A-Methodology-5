### Section A06: Graph Attention Networks in Genomics
### Mentors: Utkrisht Rajkumar, Thiago Mosqueiro

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

_The most interesting topics covered in our domain are the graphical concepts utilized in graph structured models, including message passing and random walk._

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

_We would like to investigate more on the topic of Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNAs), which are DNAs found outside of the chromosomes within the nucleus. It is associated with many types of cancer. We may focus on identifying ecDNAs from cell images._

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

_A potential change I would like to make in the approach to tackle the challenges encountered during the projects is to list some potential topics to discuss and do more preparations for the group meeting beforehand instead of doing all the researches during the meeting time._

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

_We are interested in looking at Vision Language Machines (VLM) and its application in bioinformatics. VLMs are multimodal models that take images and texts as inputs and generate text outputs._
